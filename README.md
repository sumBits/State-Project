## Description of project
The goal of this project is to combine scrolling content based sites like tumblr,
facebook, twitter, etc. This would first be a site that accomplished the goal while
being easy to use and atheistically pleasing. Then an API would be made based off
the website code then the website would be modified to run off the API and finally
an app would be created off the API.
