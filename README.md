3. npm Static server (for local testing simple drag and drop index on chrome will not work for some of the code)

### Sass
Sass is pretty easy to use learn it [here](http://sass-lang.com)

Ignore this next part if you know how to compile Sass


As for compiling sass there is a few things to do first you need to have 
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) installed don't worry we will not be coding in ruby. After you have
installed ruby run the following command (Windows/Mac):
        
    gem install sass
If that command returns errors run this:
        
    sudo gem install sass
Next check if it's installed
```sh
sass -v
```
Now to actively compile sass into css. First you must change directories to the styles folder after that run
this command:
```sh
sass --watch styles.sass:styles.css
```
To stop do Ctrl + C then enter

### Gulp
First you must have node.js installed
```sh
npm install -g gulp
 ```   
Next open the gulpfile.js and for each var look up the gulp plugin and follow instructions to install.
After you installed the plugins select the tasks you want to run by changing the array on the last line of the 
gulpfile.js then run
```sh
gulp
```    
### npm static server
    npm -g install static-server
In the directory that contains index.html
```sh
static-server
```
Open your browser and type in the address they give you. When making changes no need to run command again just
save changes then refresh page
